![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/EgidiuFarcas/youtwooz.svg?branch=master)

Youtwooz is a fan made copy of the Youtooz website where people can share their own concepts

### Installation

Youtwooz requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12+ to run.

To prepare the client:

$ npm run serve
```

To prepare the server:

```

Client will run on port ```8080``` and Server on ```3000```

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Youtwooz uses the MEVN stack for fast developing. Fell free to help improve the website!
